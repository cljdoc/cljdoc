= cljdoc Operations
:toc:

________________________________________________________________________
The intention here is not just to make it easy to spin up an environment
but also to document what is needed.
________________________________________________________________________

== Prerequsites

AWS and DigitalOcean access tokens:

[source,bash]
----
export TF_VAR_aws_access_key_id=foo
export TF_VAR_aws_secret_key=foo
export TF_VAR_do_token=digital-ocean-api-token
----

https://www.terraform.io[Terraform] and https://www.packer.io[Packer] should be installed on
your system. https://www.nomadproject.io[Nomad] and https://consul.io[Consul] are optional
and only needed if you want to interact with those systems through the CLI.

== Server Images (Packer)

We use Packer to create machine images for the cljdoc server. All
required files can be found in `./image/`. The images are based on CentOS 7.
On top of the base OS the following things are added:

- Docker
- Nomad
- Consul

For details see configuration and Systemd service files in link:image/conf[`conf/`]. All
code that is ran to prepare the image can be found in link:image/nomad.packer.json[`nomad.packer.json`].

=== Creating an Image

This requires `TF_VAR_do_token` to contain a valid DigitalOcean token.

[source,sh]
----
cd ops/image
make nomad-image-id
----

This will create an image and the image-id will be saved to `nomad-image-id`. This file is
required to proceed with the Terraform steps below.

== Infrastructure (Terraform)

We use Terraform to create various resources on AWS and DigitalOcean:

* an S3 bucket for cljdoc releases (+ user & key)
* an S3 bucket for cljdoc backups (+ user & key)
* a DigitalOcean droplet to run cljdoc
* a Route53 HostedZone for domain supplied in the configuration
* a HostedZone RecordSet to point the domain to the droplet

NOTE: The used domain can be customized in `cljdoc.tfvars`. The domain will
not be bought and it is expected that the domainâ€™s nameserver are set to
the nameservers of the Route53 HostedZone, which are part of the
outputs.

=== Common Commands

NOTE: These commands require the environment variables mentioned in
link:#prerequisites[Prerequisites] to be set.

[source,sh]
----
cd ops/infrastructure
terraform plan -var-file cljdoc.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file cljdoc.tfvars
terraform refresh -var-file cljdoc.tfvars
----

Retrieving outputs:

[source,sh]
----
terraform output
terraform output -json
terraform output main_ip
----

== Packaging (Docker)

[source,sh]
----
cd ops/docker
make image
----

This will package the cljdoc application in a Docker container. A tag will be determined
based on number of commits, branch and commit SHA. Images are published to Docker Hub during
CI. See link:/.circleci/config.yml[`.circleci/config.yml`].

== Packaging (Uberjar)

TBD.

== Orchestration (Nomad)

To deploy the cljdoc service to the provisioned infrastructure we use
https://www.nomadproject.io[Nomad]. While Nomad also provides a convenient
CLI interface it has proven easier to generate Nomad
https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/index.html[job specs]
using Clojure and submit them to the Nomad server via HTTP.

The code to do this can be found in link:/modules/deploy/[`modules/deploy`].

To run it the following commands can be used:

[source,sh]
----
cd modules/deploy/
docker_tag=$(../../script/version.sh)
clojure -m cljdoc.deploy deploy --docker-tag $docker_tag
----

This will fail unless the https://hub.docker.com/r/cljdoc/cljdoc/[cljdoc Docker repository]
has an image with the provided tag. The tag names are determined based on Git commit count,
branch and HEAD and images are pushed to Docker Hub as part of CI.

=== Accessing Nomad

[source,sh]
----
./ops/nomad.sh
----

The script above will launch an SSH process forwarding port 4646 and 8500 from the host
specified by `main_ip` in the Terraform outputs.

With Nomad installed you can now run `nomad` comands like the following:

[source,sh]
----
nomad status cljdoc
nomad alloc logs -f 683ade58
nomad deployment list
----

== Backing Up Data

See `backup.sh` and `restore.sh`.

Restoring from backups stored on S3:

[source,sh]
----
data_dir="/data/cljdoc/"
curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/cljdoc-backups/backup-2018-12-12.tar.gz -o backup.tar.gz
tar -xf backup.tar.gz -C "${data_dir}"
rm backup.tar.gz
----

== SSL Certificates

https://traefik.io[Traefik] generates SSL certificates on demand but seems to have minor
bugs here and there. If we need to drop Traefik for some reason we could look into acme.sh:

* https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh
* https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-issue-a-cert
* https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/Run-acme.sh-in-docker
