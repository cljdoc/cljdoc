(ns cljdoc.doc-tree
  "Process doctrees provided by projects via a `doc/cljdoc.edn` file.

  Projects can provide a tree of articles via the `:cljdoc.doc/tree` key.
  The data that's provided via this key roughly follows the familiar Hiccup format:

      [[\"Readme\" {:file \"Readme.md\"}
        [\"Child Of Readme\" {:file \"child.md\"}]]]

  Reading the files that are specified in this tree is outside of the
  concern of this namespace and handled via a passed-in function `slurp-fn`.
  Usually this function will read the specified file from a Git repository
  at a specified revision. This was done to keep this namespace free of any
  Git/IO-related aspects.

  The return format is described in the `::doctree` spec that's part of this namespace.

  There also is some additional code `derive-toc` that will return a
  doctree based on a list of files. This is used to derive the doctree
  for projects that haven't provided one explicitly."
