(ns cljdoc.storage.grimoire-impl
  "Grimoire is great but reading from many different places of the filesystem
  can make the code very platform dependent and harder to adapt to new contexts.

  This namespace is intended at converting data from a grimoire store into a
  developer-friendly bundle for each group/artifact/version pairing.

  A plain data file that contains all required information is an abstraction on
  top of Grimoire that will make it easier for other developers to get started
  utilizing the data stored in the Grimoire store.

  In theory the cache should contain all required information to
  restore the information into a Grimoire store although this is not
  an explicit goal.

  The cache is structured as simple as possible (a list of maps) in order
  to ease understand, avoid complexity and allow people to get started quickly.
  This may result in some duplication which I hope to mitigate by encoding the
  cache in the transit format: https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format.

  The format of the cache is defined in the spec :cljcdoc.spec/cache-bundle"
  (:require [cljdoc.spec]
            [clojure.java.io :as io]
            [clojure.tools.logging :as log]

            [grimoire.things :as things]
            [grimoire.either :as e]))

;; NOTE maybe cache contents should be versioned to some degree
;; so people can figure out which format they should expect?
;; This could become especially useful in a context where a tool
;; may work with older caches that have been generated with
;; a different cache-contents layout.
