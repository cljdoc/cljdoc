  "Monitor for new library releases between hourly bulk checks done by cljdoc.server.search.api.

  We only monitor clojars and not maven central.

  Maven Central
  - does not hold many clojure libs (notable exception is org.clojure libs)
  - their team asks that we only make necessary calls to their APIs to reduce overall traffic
  - existing hourly bulk update check is sufficient
  - manual invokation of doc building is still possible for the impatient"
