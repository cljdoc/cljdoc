  "By default, pedestal ties routing to handlers/interceptors.

  It is a awkward to go against the pedestal-way, but we decoupled routes
  from handlers.

  One big plus of decoupling is that it allows us to expose a `url-for` a given route + params
  for use by our renderers. (There is a interceptor-scoped `url-for` in the pedestal API,
  but it was a bit too magic for our taste).

  Routes can be optionally hooked up to handlers by the `route-resolver` passed into `routes`."
