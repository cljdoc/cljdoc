Short answers to common questions.

== Can I update docs after a release to Clojars?

Yes, you can update articles after a release, see link:/doc/userguide/for-library-authors.adoc#overriding-articles-revision[Overriding Articles Revision].

For all other updates, youâ€™ll need to cut a new release to Clojars.

& Verifying]

== How does cljdoc compare to clojuredocs.org?

Cljdoc has in many ways been inspired by clojuredocs.org but besides documenting Clojure itself, cljdoc tries to provide documentation for the library ecosystem around Clojure.

The projects are not related besides both pushing documentation in the Clojure ecosystem forward :hugs:
