== Why Cljdoc?

Cljdoc offers a centralized hosted library of docs which are:

* Easy to publish
* Automatically stay up to date
* Discoverable by users
* Look good

[[basic-setup]]
== The Bare Minimum

If you publish your library to https://clojars.org[Clojars], its docs should already be available (or available to build) on https://cljdoc.org[cljdoc.org].

Default handling:

* link:#api[API] automatically documented
* link:#articles[Articles] include `README`, `CHANGELOG` and articles under `doc/` (else `docs/`), see link:#auto-discovered-articles[auto-discovered articles]

== Mechanics

When cljdoc is link:#triggers[triggered] to build your library's documentation, it:

. Downloads your library's release jar from Clojars
. Analyzes your library's link:#git-sources[sources on git]
. Analyzes your library's jar to discover its public link:#api[API].

After building your docs, they are available at https://cljdoc.org[cljdoc.org] for online and link:for-users.md#offline-docs[offline] browsing.

See also: link:/doc/cljdoc-developer-technical-guide.adoc#system-overview[System Overview].

[[markup]]
== Markup Formats

Cljdoc supports two markup formats:

* *Markdown* for API link:#docstrings[docstrings] and `.md` link:#articles[articles]
** We use https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java[flexmark-java] to render a https://github.github.com/gfm/[GitHub flavored CommonMark dialect].
* *AsciiDoc* for `.adoc` link:#articles[articles]
** We use https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[AsciidoctorJ] to render https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoc].

[[badges]]
== Cljdoc Badge
[IMPORTANT]
====
The following examples use `metosin/malli`.
Replace with your library's Clojars [.nowrap]#`group-id/artifact-id`# (hint: not the GitHub org/repo name).
====

Include a cljdoc badge in your README. Here malli's badge:
https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/malli[image:https://cljdoc.org/badge/metosin/malli[cljdoc badge]].

* Badge URL: `https://cljdoc.org/badge/metosin/malli`

[[git-sources]]
== Git Sources

Cljdoc starts with the release jar downloaded from Clojars.
A jar is associated with its specific git revision of sources via the `<scm>` entry in the jar's `pom`.
This allows cljdoc to consult git hosted:

* link:#cljdoc-config[cljdoc config] - options on how cljdoc should process your docs
* link:#articles[articles] - to include and present as part of your docs
* sources files - to allows cljdoc to intelligently link back to articles, link:#api[API] source code, and your git repo

TIP: a valid `pom` `<scm>` also allows other services like Clojars to point back to your release's sources.

[NOTE]
====
* SCM stands for Source Control Management
* pom is the Maven Project Object Model
====

An example `<scm>` entry from `metosin/malli`:

[source,xml]
----
  <scm>
    <url>https://github.com/metosin/malli</url>
    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/metosin/malli.git</connection>
    <developerConnection>scm:git:ssh://git@github.com/metosin/malli.git</developerConnection>
    <tag>0.8.4</tag>
  </scm>
----

Another from `juxt/bidi`:
[source,xml]
----
  <scm>
    <url>https://github.com/juxt/bidi</url>
    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/juxt/bidi.git</connection>
    <developerConnection>scm:git:ssh://git@github.com/juxt/bidi.git</developerConnection>
    <tag>d1bfcc9c4fe247b8ada19cd7ee25acd81dd93f26</tag>
  </scm>
----

Cljdoc will look at the `<url>` and the `<tag>`:

* `<url>` points to your hosted git repo
* `<tag>` is a valid pointer to the git revision of your release's sources.
It can be a git tag, or commit sha.

TIP: You can optionally link:#articles-override[override] the revision for articles.

NOTE: We strongly recommend you explicitly specify the `<tag>` in your `pom.xml` for cljdoc and other tools. +
But... If you do not specify a `<tag>`, cljdoc will search for a version tag based on the artifact version.
For artifact version `1.2.3` it will look for a git tag `1.2.3` (else `v1.2.3`).

NOTE: Cljdoc will assume a found version tag is equivalent to `<tag>` even when the `<tag>` specifies a commit sha.

Here are some common ways folks set `<scm>` values:

* By hand. You can edit a `pom.xml` manually when cutting a release, but this can be error-prone.
* https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build[Clojure tools build] can be asked to populate the `<scm>` value.
Cybermonday provides https://github.com/kiranshila/cybermonday/blob/17bb2c412171283440276a0a8e2cfd6f252aad91/build/build.clj#L27-L30[a good example of doing just that].
* https://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] will automatically create the `<scm>` entry for you if you set the https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/bd3ecfcfb20ef7a79912879ff892e0f2317e8691/sample.project.clj#L490[`:scm` in your `project.clj`].
For example:
+
[source,clojure]
----
    :scm {:name "git" :url "https://github.com/your-github-org/your-project"}
----
* https://github.com/boot-clj/boot[Boot] also has support, pass the `:scm` option to the `pom` task, an https://github.com/martinklepsch/derivatives/blob/f9cc6be8eeaf21513641cb09d5a466e34ecdd565/build.boot#L18-L23[example].

Whatever method you choose, take care to ensure that your jar's pom points back to the exact revision of its sources on git.

[[articles-override]]
=== Overriding Articles Revision
Sometimes you'll want cljdoc to present articles from your git repo after your library's release commit.
For examples:

* a README that includes the git sha of the release will necessarily appear in a commit after the library release.
* perhaps you'd like fix or edit an article without cutting a new release
* you'd like to adjust your link:#cljdoc-config[article table of contents]

To support these scenarios, cljdoc recognizes the `cljdoc-<version>` git tag.
For library version `1.2.3` cljdoc will look for git tag `cljdoc-1.2.3` (or `cljdoc-v1.2.3`) and import your articles from that commit instead of the link:#git-sources[default commit].

If you add/move a `cljdoc-<version>` tag after the initial cljdoc build is complete, you can request a link:#rebuild[rebuild].

TIP: This affects articles only.
Any changes to docstrings will require a new library release.

TIP: You'll want to make articles adjustments before you start working on your next release.
All articles are re-imported.

[[cljdoc-config]]
== Configuration

When building your docs, cljdoc will look under the `doc` (else `docs`) directory for a `cljdoc.edn` file in your link:#git-sources[library's git repo].

You can use this configuration file to tell cljdoc more about your documentation.

* `:cljdoc.doc/tree` - Tells cljdoc what link:#articles[articles] to present and in what hierarchy. +
By default, cljdoc will link:#auto-discovered-articles[automatically discover articles].
* `:cljdoc/languages` - Tells cljdoc which link:#languages[languages] your API uses. +
By default, cljdoc will automatically detect languages based on the sources it finds in your jar.
* `:cljdoc/include-namespaces-from-dependencies` - Tells cljdoc to amalgamate API docs from multiple link:#modules[modules]. +
Rarely used, but very useful when your project is made up of modules.

As an example, a version of https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql[honeysql]'s `cljdoc.edn`
[source,Clojure]
----
{:cljdoc.doc/tree
 [["Readme" {:file "README.md"}]
  ["Changes" {:file "CHANGELOG.md"}]
  ["Getting Started" {:file "doc/getting-started.md"}
   ["General Reference" {:file "doc/general-reference.md"}]
   ["SQL Clause Reference" {:file "doc/clause-reference.md"}]
   ["SQL Operator Reference" {:file "doc/operator-reference.md"}]
   ["SQL 'Special Syntax'" {:file "doc/special-syntax.md"}]
   ["PostgreSQL Support" {:file "doc/postgresql.md"}]
   ["Extending HoneySQL" {:file "doc/extending-honeysql.md"}]]
  ["Differences from 1.x" {:file "doc/differences-from-1-x.md"}]]}
----

== Linking to docs on cljdoc
See also: link:#badges[badges].

[[link-articles]]
=== Link to articles

* When linking from article to link:#articles[article], use relative or root-relative links.
Cljdoc will rewrite built article to article links automatically. Markdown examples:
** `[root relative link](/doc/some-doc.md)`
** `[relative link](other-doc.md)`
* When linking from docstring to article, use root relative links. Markdown example:
** `[root relative link](/doc/some-doc.md)`
* When linking from outside your git repo:
** doc home page
*** `https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/malli`
** a specific doc in the current release, uses link:#slugs[article slugs]
*** `https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/malli/CURRENT/doc/changelog`
** a specific doc for release `0.7.5`, uses link:#slugs[article slugs]
*** `https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/malli/0.7.5/doc/readme`

=== Link to API docs

* When linking from docstring to API docs, use the link:#wikilink[`+[[wikilink]]+`] 
* When linking from article to API docs, or from outside your git repo:
** link to var `malli.core/explain` in current release
*** `https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/malli/CURRENT/api/malli.core#explain`
** link to namespace `malli.core` in release 0.7.5
*** `https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/malli/0.7.5/api/malli.core`

[[api]]
== API Documentation

=== Declaring your Public API

Cljdoc will document all namespaces and public vars it finds.
To exclude namespaces and/or vars from API documentation, annotate them with `:no-doc` metadata:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn ^:no-doc hidden "Won't see me on cljdoc.org!" [x])
----

[source,clojure]
----
(ns ^:no-doc namespace.hidden
  "This ns shouldn't show in the docs.")
----

[source,clojure]
----
(ns namespace.hidden
  "This ns shouldn't show in the docs."
  {:no-doc true})
----

[[languages]]
=== API Languages
Cljdoc will auto-detect which languages your library supports based on the types of source files it finds.
You can choose to override this auto-detection in your `doc/cljdoc.edn` file via the `:cljdoc/languages` option.

|===
| Example `:cljdoc/languages` value | API Analysis run for

a| `["clj"]` | Clojure only
a| `["cljs"]` | ClojureScript only
a| `["clj" "cljs"]` | Both Clojure and ClojureScript
a| `:auto-detect` | Dependent upon source files found in your library,
the default behavior.
|===

Example usage:
[source,Clojure]
----
{:cljdoc/languages ["clj"]}
----

=== Getting Dependencies Right

Cljdoc discovers your API via dynamic runtime analysis.
It will try to load all namespaces found in your jar.
If a dependency is not found, the load, and therefore API analysis, will fail.

If you include namespaces that require additional/optional dependencies, make sure you declare them in your `pom.xml`.

If these dependencies are expected to be provided by, for example, some container or JVM, mark them with a `scope` of `"provided"` in our `pom.xml`.
Provided dependencies are skipped at runtime, but inform cljdoc they are required for API analysis.

TIP: You can express `provided` in a `project.clj`, for https://github.com/funcool/cats/blob/d1b7f3d60c7791798182937c54cbafa4e81536d4/project.clj#L6-L12[example].
The `deps.edn` file does not support scoping, you'll have to express these directly in your `pom.xml`.

Cljdoc will automatically search Clojars and Maven Central for dependencies.
If any of your library's dependencies are hosted elsewhere, those maven repositories will need to be specified in your `pom.xml`.
This includes any transitive dependencies.

[TIP]
====
You can specify maven repositories:

* in a `project.clj` under `:repositories`, for https://github.com/IamDrowsy/cloudship/blob/93ebdf7fdb1f404436ccdb68fafc8cd4f88ab256/project.clj#L30[example].
* in a `deps.edn` under `:mvn/repos`, for https://github.com/phronmophobic/membrane.term/blob/d1c8eb6f682b797e371fe8a6e9e1e9caf7dbc79b/deps.edn#L20-L21[example].
====

[[docstrings]]
=== Docstrings

Docstrings are rendered as link:#markup[Markdown]. Consider https://www.martinklepsch.org/posts/writing-awesome-docstrings.html[these recommendations] when writing your docstrings:

1. Backtick-Quote ``` function arguments & special keywords to `make` them `stand` out `more`
2. Link to other functions using link:#wikilink[`+[[wikilink]]+`] syntax
3. Include small examples using markdown fenced `\```Clojure ... ```` code blocks 
4. Use Markdown tables to describe complex options maps
5. You can include images and links to articles, just be sure to use git repo root-relative links (links that start with a `/`):
  * `![my image](/dir1/dir2/image1.png)`
  * `[my article](/dir1/dir2/article.adoc)`

Any HTML embedded within docstrings is escaped.

[[wikilink]]
==== Wikilinks

You can link to other namespaces and functions from your docstrings using the `\[[wikilink]]` syntax.

Note that if you want to link to vars outside the current namespace you need to either fully qualify those vars or specify them relative to the current namespace. An example: if you want to link to `compojure.core/GET` from `compojure.route` you'll need to provide the wiki in one of the two forms below:

----
[[compojure.core/GET]]
[[core/GET]]
----

[[articles]]
== Article Documentation

Libraries often include additional guides and tutorials in link:#markup[markup] files.
Cljdoc calls these articles.

For cljdoc to find your articles:

* They must be stored inside your project's git repository
* Your git repository must be link:#git-sources[properly linked to your git sources]

This allows cljdoc to retrieve article files at the revision/commit of the release.

=== Automatic Link Rewriting

Cljdoc hosted articles will have their links link:#link-articles[rewritten to link back to cljdoc].
All links that work on GitHub should also work on cljdoc.

[[auto-discovered-articles]]
=== Auto-discovered Articles

If your git repository does not contain a link:#article-config[doc tree configuration], cljdoc will automatically include:

* `README.md` else `README.adoc` - filename search is case insensitive
** Title is `Readme`
* `CHANGELOG.md` else `CHANGELOG.adoc`- filename search is case insensitive
** Title is `Changelog`
* link:#markup[Markup] articles from your `doc/` else `docs/` folder
** The title is read from the file's first heading. There will be no nesting and articles will be ordered alphabetically by filename.

TIP: Use filenames prefixed with digits like `01-intro.md` to define the order of articles.

[[article-config]]
=== Configuring Articles

If you need more control, use a `doc/cljdoc.edn` file to specify a tree of articles.

Assuming you have a directory `doc/` in your repository as follows:

----
doc/
  getting-started.md
  installation.md
  configuration.md
----

You can explicitly add these articles to your cljdoc build by with the following `doc/cljdoc.edn` file:

[source,clojure]
----
{:cljdoc.doc/tree [["Readme" {:file "README.md"}]
                   ["Getting Started" {:file "doc/getting-started.md"}
                    ["Installation" {:file "doc/installation.md"}]]
                   ["Configuration" {:file "doc/configuration.md"}]]}
----

Your articles will be presented with the following hierarchy and titles:

----
├── Readme
├── Getting Started
│   └── Installation
└── Configuration
----

TIP: Cljdoc will always present the readme and changelog articles first.

IMPORTANT: The resulting URLs for those articles will be based on the title provided in the `cljdoc.edn` file and _not_ on the filename or title within the article file.

See also: link:#verifying-articles[verifying articles]

[[slugs]]
=== Article Slugs

Slugs for articles are currently based on the article title.
Titles can be link:#article-config[explicitly configured] or link:#auto-discovered-articles[discovered].

=== AsciiDoc Environment

Similar to `env-github` on GitHub, cljdoc will set an `env-cljdoc` attribute when
rendering your AsciiDoc file. This allows you to hide or show sections
of your document or set configuration parameters.

As an example, this AsciiDoctor snippet:
[source,asciidoc,literal]
----
\ifdef::env-cljdoc[]
THIS WILL BE SHOWN ON CLJDOC
\endif::[]
\ifndef::env-cljdoc[]
THIS WILL BE SHOWN EVERYWHERE ELSE
\endif::[]
----

will render as so:

ifdef::env-cljdoc[]
THIS WILL BE SHOWN ON CLJDOC
endif::[]
ifndef::env-cljdoc[]
THIS WILL BE SHOWN EVERYWHERE ELSE
endif::[]

[[verifying]]
== Testing & Verifying

=== Previewing Docs Locally

You can preview what your docs will look like before a Clojars release by link:/doc/running-cljdoc-locally.adoc[running cljdoc locally].

=== Snapshot Builds

If you are already publishing `-SNAPSHOT` releases to Clojars, this can also be a useful way to experiment/preview on cljdoc.

We recommend that you populate `<scm>` `<tag>` in your `pom.xml` with the git commit sha of your snapshot release.

Cljdoc does not automatically build snapshot releases, but they will show up in the library search result.
Upon selecting a snapshot release, cljdoc will offer to build its docset.

By its nature, a snapshot release will likely have many releases under the same version.
You can choose to link:#rebuild[rebuild] for against the current releases.

[[verifying-articles]]
=== Article Verification Script

Sometimes people forget to update the paths after moving files around, we recommend you add the following to your CI setup:

[source,shell]
----
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cljdoc/cljdoc/master/script/verify-cljdoc-edn | bash -s doc/cljdoc.edn
----

=== GitHub Action
We have a https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc-check-action[Cljdoc check action] you can incorporate into your CI workflows.

[[triggers]]
== Doc Build Triggers

* Automatically
** Every 60 seconds, cljdoc reaches out to clojars to discover new releases.
** Every 10 minutes, it queues new releases to build
* By request at cljdoc.org
** If cljdoc has not already built a requested version of a library, you are given the option to build it from https://cljdoc.org[cljdoc.org].
* By rebuild request at cljdoc.org
[[rebuild]]
** If your docs have already been built, you can request a rebuild via the barely visible rebuild hover link on the top right corner of your library docs page: 
+
image::cljdoc-rebuild-link.png[]
* By REST request
** An automated release process can trigger a build via rest link:/doc/docsets.md#trigger-a-build-for-a-project[trigger a cljdoc build via REST].

[[modules]]
== Module Support

Some libraries are made up of submodules.
Cljdoc provides some support amalgamating docs for these types of libraries.

=== APIs

To include API documentation for some or all of a projects submodules, specify their *maven coordinates* under `:cljdoc/include-namespaces-from-dependencies`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:cljdoc/include-namespaces-from-dependencies
 [metosin/reitit
  metosin/reitit-core
  metosin/reitit-ring
  metosin/reitit-spec
  metosin/reitit-schema
  metosin/reitit-swagger
  metosin/reitit-swagger-ui]}
----

NOTE: To be included, each dependency must also be specified as a maven dependency of the project itself (in the project's `deps.edn`, `project.clj`, etc).
The project's resulting POM file will be used to load API information for the correct version.

TIP: https://github.com/metosin/reitit[Reitit] is a great example reference for a project with submodules.

WARNING: If analysis for a specified dependency has failed or hasn't been run, its API documentation will not appear on cljdoc.

=== Articles

The following example shows how to provide a different doc tree for project `metosin/reitit` via `cljdoc.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
{
  ;; used for metosin/reitit
  ;; when building docs for metosin/reitit this will be used as if
  ;; the doc/cljdoc.edn file contained just the value of this key
  metosin/reitit {:cljdoc.doc/tree [["Introduction" {:file "intro.md"}]]}

  ;; used for any project except metosin/reitit
  ;; could contain an overview about all modules and a pointer
  ;; to the overarching documentation for metosin/reitit
  :cljdoc.doc/tree [["Overview" {:file "modules/README.md"}]]
}
----

NOTE: We haven't found an example usage of this in the wild yet.
