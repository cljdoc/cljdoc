Short answers to common questions.

# Can I update docs after a release to Clojars?

No, not yet, but we will allow for this in the future.
[#31](https://github.com/martinklepsch/cljdoc/issues/31)

For now, to update docs you'll need to cut a new release to Clojars.

# How does cljdoc compare to clojuredocs.org?

Cljdoc has in many ways been inspired by clojuredocs.org but besides
documenting Clojure itself, cljdoc tries to provide documentation for
the library ecosystem around Clojure.

The projects are not related besides both pushing documentation in the
Clojure ecosystem forward :hugs:
