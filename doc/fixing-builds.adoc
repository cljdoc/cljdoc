= Fixing cljdoc builds
:idprefix:

:toc:

In order for cljdoc to show API documentation we need to analyse each project.
This analysis can fail for a variety of reasons:

* missing dependencies
* analysis ran on an unsupported platform

This document aims to outline some ways for the community to help fix those broken builds.

WARNING: This document is a work in progress and may get out of date more quickly than others.

== Find a broken build

[arabic]
. Go to https://cljdoc.org/builds
. Find any build with a red marker on the right (usually ``analysis-job-failed'')
. Get to the build page by clicking on the build ID next to the project name:
. On the build page you can go the the CI job where you will be able to see a stack trace and other output that was made during the build.
. If a namespace is missing there likely is some dependency issue.

If you’re having trouble diagnosing the issue, jump on Slack or open an issue and other folks can help out.

== Fixing dependency issues

There are two ways to fix dependency issues:

[arabic]
. Fixing the issue at the source (i.e. the project’s `project.clj`, `build.boot` or `deps.edn` file)
. Hardcoding a fix for the issue within cljdoc

Option *1)* should always be done but just doing *1)* won’t fix the
build for previous releases. This is where *2)* comes in.

=== An Example

Let’s assume a project `my/project` has a namespace `project.http` which is considered optional and requires `clj-http.client`.
Now because that namespace is optional the author of `my/project` did not include `clj-http` in the projects dependencies.
It is expected that users add this dependency themselves when using the `project.http` namespace.

In this situation cljdoc will try to generate API documentation for `project.http` (because it’s a namespace included in the jar) but will fail because a required namespace (`clj-http.client`) is missing.

To fix this in the original project a proper dependency on `clj-http` should be added.
If it should not be included by default you can add a `:scope "provided"` qualifier which will exclude that dependency by default but still list it in the project’s dependencies (`.pom` file).

[source,clj]
----
[clj-http "3.9.1" :scope "provided"]
----

Once a new release with this change is made the build should work (assuming no other issues).
It’s usually a good idea to https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc/blob/master/doc/running-cljdoc-locally.adoc[test things locally].
This is part *1)* described above.

For already released versions we should still do part *2)* in some capacity.

This is where https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc-analyzer/blob/master/src/cljdoc_analyzer/deps.clj[`deps.clj`] comes in.

This namespace is generally intended to take care of any manual dependency adjustments.

In most cases a small adjustment to `hardcoded-deps` is probably all that’s needed but if you’re uncertain, just open a PR and we can work it out together.
