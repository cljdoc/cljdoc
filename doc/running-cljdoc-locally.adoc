= Running cljdoc Locally

[[introduction]]
== Guides
There are different motivations for running cljdoc locally on your computer.
If you are a:

. *library author* interested in **verifying** that your **docs look good** before publishing, read link:running-cljdoc-locally-author.adoc[running cljdoc locally for library authors].
. *cljdoc developer* wanting to **contribute** to **cljdoc itself**, refer to link:running-cljdoc-locally-dev.adoc[running cljdoc locally for cljdoc developers].
