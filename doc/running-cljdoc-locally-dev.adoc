== Audience
You are a cljdoc developer who wants to run cljdoc locally while making changes to cljdoc itself.

Library authors should instead read link:running-cljdoc-locally-author.adoc[running cljdoc locally for library authors].

== Run cljdoc Locally From Source

=== Prerequisites
To run cljdoc from source, you must first install these dependencies:

* https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js]
* https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot[Java Development Kit 17] - the cljdoc web server currently runs on JDK17 in production, so ideally, you'll want to be developing with JDK17 too.
Example of a valid JDK:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ java -version
openjdk version "17.0.1" 2021-10-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.1+12 (build 17.0.1+12)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.1+12 (build 17.0.1+12, mixed mode, sharing)
----
* https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Clojure CLI tools] - make sure you have upgraded to the current version
* https://github.com/babashka/babashka[Babashka] - some of our scripts are written in babashka
* https://git-scm.com[Git]

=== Launch cljdoc Server

. Clone cljdoc (adjust as appropriate when you are working from a fork of cljdoc)
+
[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc.git
cd cljdoc
----

. Build the JavaScript files used by the cljdoc pages:

** If you want to replicate production:
+
[source,shell]
----
npm ci                 # reproducibly install packages into node_modules
npm run format         # format JS code with Prettier
npm run build          # production build
----
+
Check that `resources-compiled` folder was generated.

** If you are a developer planning to work on JavaScript files (instead of `npm run build` we have `npm run dev`):
+
[source,shell]
----
npm ci                 # reproducibly install packages into node_modules
npm run format         # format JS code with Prettier
npm run dev            # watch mode for automatic rebuilding of JavaScript files
----
+
NOTE: Leave watch mode session open. Continue any work in a separate terminal shell.
. Start the cljdoc web server
+
[source,shell]
----
./script/cljdoc run
----
+
IMPORTANT: Leave this web server session open. Continue any work in a separate terminal shell.
+
Alternatively you can start a REPL with `clj` (or your favorite editor integration), then load the system, move into its namespace and start the server:
+
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[cljdoc.server.system])
(in-ns 'cljdoc.server.system)
(require '[integrant.repl])
(integrant.repl/set-prep! #(system-config (cfg/config)))
(integrant.repl/go)
----

. (Optional, but recommended) Run tests.
It is recommended that you run tests before making any changes.
This way you'll be pretty sure that the cljdoc main branch and your local setup are sound.
From the cljdoc directory:
+
[source,clojure]
----
clojure -M:test
----

== Import a Library's Docs
Here's an overview of importing library docs when running cljdoc locally:

image::running-local.svg[running locally overview]

NOTE: In the discussions that follow, we'll assume that your hosted SCM (Source Code Management) system is GitHub.

TIP: If your project has link:/doc/userguide/for-library-authors.adoc#module-support[sub modules], you'll need to ingest each of the sub modules in order to see their APIs on your locally running cljdoc web server.

=== Example Library
We have chosen {example-project-link}, {example-project-desc}, as our example import library.
Feel free to substitute your own, or another, library when walking through examples.

=== Importing a Published Library
If you have an unpublished work in progress you'd like to import for preview, instead see <<importing-unpublished-library>>.

Steps 1 and 2 don't apply here, we can move directly to steps 3 then 4.

[TIP]
====
If you have been testing {example-project-name} {example-project-version} locally, be sure to first delete it from your local maven repository.

[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/{example-project-maven-path}/{example-project-version}
----
====

To import {example-project-name} {example-project-version}:

[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
../cljdoc/script/cljdoc ingest \
  --project {example-project-coords} \
  --version {example-project-version}
----

You can now <<browse>>.

[[importing-unpublished-library]]
=== Importing an Unpublished Library

If you are going to walk through the examples, you'll want to clone {example-project-link}.
Fork it if you want to walk though pushing changes for a full preview.

All example commands assume you are running from your library project root dir, and that both cljdoc and your project share the same parent dir.

[TIP]
====
Repeat steps 1 through 4 as needed (see overview diagram).
Confusion can usually be resolved by asking:

* Did I remember to commit/push to GitHub?
* Did I remember to install to my local maven repository?
====

==== Step 1) Commit/Push Library Changes
Cljdoc only imports from 2 sources: your jar file and your GitHub repo.

[TIP]
====
If you want a full preview where you can verify that references to your GitHub repo work work, then you'll need to push your commits to GitHub.
References to GitHub include:

* links from articles and docstrings to articles, images, etc.
* links from API vars and functions to back to their source on GitHub
====

==== Step 2) Install Library Locally
To publish {example-project-name} to your local maven repository, run:

[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{example-project-local-install}
----

[TIP]
====
The command issued to install a library to the local maven repo varies by build technology (leiningen, boot, tools deps cli, etc) and project.
The `{example-project-local-install}` command is appropriate for {example-project-name}, be sure to use the appropriate command for your project.
====

==== Step 3) Import Library Docs

Perhaps you want to verify some library that is not available on clojars.

Normally cljdoc will look in your published library's `pom.xml` under `project/scm` to learn what GitHub `url` and `tag` it should use to reference articles and source code.
To avoid having to alter your `pom.xml` while testing changes during development, the cljdoc `ingest` command provides:

* `--git` to override `pom.xml` `project/scm/url`
* `--rev` to override `pom.xml` `project/scm/tag`

You have a choice on how to handle relative references from docs to other files (e.g. images, source code, etc) in your library's GitHub repository when testing locally:

* *Quick preview* `--git` specifies your library's root directory on your local filesystem.
+
WARNING: In a quick preview, relative references to GitHub WON'T work.
+
From {example-project-name}'s root dir:
+
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
../cljdoc/script/cljdoc ingest \
  --project {example-project-coords} \
  --version {example-project-version} \
  --git $(pwd) \
  --rev $(git rev-parse HEAD)
----

* *Full preview* `--git` specifies your library's https GitHub project URL.
+
NOTE: In a full preview, relative references to GitHub DO work.
+
TIP: Change `pass:a[{example-project-import-url}]` to your own org if you have forked {example-project-name}.
+
From {example-project-name}'s root dir:
+
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
../cljdoc/script/cljdoc ingest \
  --project {example-project-coords} \
  --version {example-project-version} \
  --git {example-project-import-url} \
  --rev $(git rev-parse HEAD)
----

[[browse]]
==== Step 4) Browse Library Docs
The final step is you browsing the imported library docs in your web browser.
For example, after importing version {example-project-version} of {example-project-name} you'd browse the docs locally via: +
http://localhost:8000/d/{example-project-coords}/{example-project-version}

[NOTE]
====
When testing locally, you may also want verify what your library docs look like as an offline bundle: +
http://localhost:8000/download/{example-project-coords}/{example-project-version}.
